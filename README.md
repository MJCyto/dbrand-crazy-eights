This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

Creating a server-side rendered web application using Redux Toolkit under a strict time constraint.
This application may receive edits to allow it to be deployed (ie. removal of branding)

This application was made within a few days with one request added - to fix initial rendering for styled-components and some accessibility improvements.
